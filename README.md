# Awesome-Extruders

A 3D printer extruder is a filament feeding mechanism used in many fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printers. 

This is a list of publicaly available extruder designs which can be built using a combination of 3d printed parts and a purchasable gear kit.

### BMG Gear Extruders
<img src="bmg.png" width="495" height="330">

[BMG gears](https://www.bondtech.se/product-category/extruders/bmg-series/?srsltid=AfmBOoqG_gRRpSIDdcMdXtBJIBlN_L-gR9r2ktUPrTVjUjdEChwsAM0k) are part of a kit 
from the popular BMG extruder created by Bondtech. They are available either as a standard kit, where the extruder and drive gear are two seperate pieces, or 
as IDGA (Integrated Drive Gear Assembly), where the extruder and drive gear are a single piece. Opt for the IDGA, variant if the extruder supports it, for better layer stacking. 
These gear kits are available from a wide variety of vendors. Be aware that many vendors sell clones that have a wide variety of quality control.

### HGX-lite Extruders
<img src="hgx-lite.jpg" width="400" height="400">

[HGX-lite gears](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804512828973.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2usa4itemAdapt) are a set of large extruder gears from the HGX-lite extruder believed to be created by Haldis 3D. They also sell the gears standalone as a gear set. These are essentially a clone of the LGX-lite gears. They come in two variants, HGX-Lite and HGX-lite 2.0.  Most extruders featuring these gears are using the original 1.0 version. The 2.0 variant is slightly lighter and can be identified by the extra holes in the drive gears.
