### HGX-lite Extruders
[HGX-lite Gears](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804512828973.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2usa4itemAdapt) are a set of large extruder gears from the HGX-lite extruder believed to be created by Haldis 3D. They sell the gears stand alone as a gear set. These are essentially a clone of the LGX-lite gears however its uncertain how similar exactly they are. They come in two variants, HGX-Lite a HGX-lite 2.0.  Most extruders using these gears are using the original version. The 2.0 variant is slightly lighter and can be identified by its extra holes in the gears.
