# Awesome-Extruders

A 3D printer extruder is a filament feeding mechanism used in many fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printers. 

This is a list of publicaly available extruder designs which can be built using a combination of 3d printed parts and a purchasable gear kit. Sections are broken up by gear type.

### Community Picks
- The Popularity Contest: [Wristwatch](https://github.com/bythorsthunder/Voron_Mods/tree/main/Wristwatch_Extruder_BMG) has taken the community by storm, quickly becoming the most popular standalone extuder. There are remixes for BMG, G2, RIDGA, and IDGA gears, its easy to build, and supports filament cutters and filament sensors for multicolor.
- The Classic: [Sherpa Mini](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Sherpa_Mini-Extruder) has been around linger than most of the extruders on the list and for good reason. Its lightweight and to print and assemble. This design inspired nearly every BMG based extruder on the list and has more remixes than any other design to date. She might be showing her age but its still a solid design.
- The Bargain Mart: - [ProtoXtruder](https://github.com/nhchiu/VoronMods/tree/main/Extruders/ProtoXtruder), designed by nhchiu, is part of a family of extuders using the HGX-lite gears. These large gears can be found for $8-15 and include every non-printed part needed. Between the low price, the large gears improving layer consistency, and the extruder using the same mounting pattern as Sherpa-Mini, its a awesome budget extruder.

### BMG Extruders
<img src="bmg.png" width="495" height="330">

[BMG gears](https://www.bondtech.se/product-category/extruders/bmg-series/?srsltid=AfmBOoqG_gRRpSIDdcMdXtBJIBlN_L-gR9r2ktUPrTVjUjdEChwsAM0k) are part of a kit 
from the popular BMG extruder created by Bondtech. They are available either as a standard kit, where the extruder and drive gear are two seperate pieces, IDGA (Integrated Drive Gear Assembly), where the extruder and drive gear are a single piece, or RIDGA (Reverse IDGA). 
Opt for RIDGA/IDGA, if the extruder supports it, for better layer stacking. 
These gear kits are available from a variety of vendors. Be aware that many vendors sell clones that have varying quality control.

### HGX-lite Extruders
<img src="hgx-lite.jpg" width="400" height="400">

[HGX-lite gears](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804512828973.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2usa4itemAdapt) are a set of large extruder gears from the HGX-lite extruder believed to be created by Haldis 3D. They also sell the gears standalone as a gear set. These are essentially a clone of the LGX-lite gears. They come in two variants, HGX-Lite and HGX-lite 2.0.  Most extruders featuring these gears are using the original 1.0 version. The 2.0 variant is slightly lighter and can be identified by the extra holes in the drive gears.
